                    <p class="card-text">
                        I used the js game engine Phaser 3 for this project. It uses the GPU acceleration for physics and rendering of webGL on the canvas instead of making the CPU do all the rendering and calculation.
                        <br><br>
                        I planned to go with my own game engine, but I soon realized that it would take way too much time for the profit I would get from it.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the problems I was faced with when trying to create it was how to get the notion of a rendered frame into a canvas that holds what was drawn on it before, which isn't easily solvable.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        I wanted to make this website understandable by anyone who would want to look at it. That's why all my variable names, all my comments and even this page right now is in english.
                        <br><br>
                        Writing code that is only readable by roughly 300 millions people (as of 2019) out of 7 billion is meaningless and should be avoided to prevent the pain of all the non-french speaking people trying to maintain that code.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        This is called Tile Bleeding, and is caused by how Phaser 3 uses the textures of the tileset. It can't be easily fixed. Since all of this was just a proof of concept I thought it was just fine as is.

                    <h4 class="card-title">Why doesn't the game work in my browser?!</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        My code uses js ECMA-script 6 class syntax, arrow functions, and the variable declarations const and let.
                        <br>
                        All of tests during the development of this project was based on Chrome 73.
                        <br><br>
                        A way to fix this compatilibity issue would be to use webpack or browserify to make this project legacy-compatible via a bundle. Tho if I did that I would have greatly exceeded the limit of 2MB for the project just on the js script alone
